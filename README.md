The main source for how to structure a GAN and WGAN, including architecture structuring, and 
gradient penalty function, was taken from [Erik Linder-Nor√©n's](https://github.
com/eriklindernoren) GitHub repo of PyTorch implementations of Generative Adversarial Networks: 
[PyTorch-GAN](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN), licensed under MIT license.

- MIT license from GAN structure
- Idea for patch: patch paper
- 


Note: I assume square images
Note: I assume each patch has width = image_width

Note: patch width is assumed  to be 28 (width of the whole image)
This choice is based on finding of the PQWGAN paper, where they observed that
horizontal patches worked well for the structure.
